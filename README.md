**Description:**
Welcome to the Self-Stabilization Platform Prototype repository! 🌟

Are you tired of experiencing motion sickness and seasickness while traveling through challenging terrains? Look no further! We've got a groundbreaking solution for you. 

Our six-person team has developed an innovative self-stabilization platform prototype inspired by the remarkable stability of camera gimbals. This platform holds the potential to revolutionize your travel experience, making those bumpy rides a thing of the past.

**Key Features:**

🚀 **Advanced Stabilization:** Our prototype harnesses the power of cutting-edge technology to ensure a smooth and comfortable journey, no matter the terrain.

📷 **Gimbal-inspired Design:** Drawing inspiration from camera gimbals, our platform offers exceptional stability even in the roughest conditions.

🧠 **AI-Powered Control:** We've incorporated a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a Feed-Forward learning mode to significantly reduce response times of the gimbal.

🛤️ **Terrain Navigation:** Our CNN model is specially trained on a dataset sourced from NVIDIA for automatic terrain navigation, making it adaptable to various landscapes.

🔄 **Multi-Axis Support:** The model's parameters are finely tuned to handle both left and right turning as well as rolling movements along the y-axis, ensuring a seamless experience.

Join us on this exciting journey to combat motion sickness and elevate your travel adventures. Say goodbye to nausea, and hello to a new era of stability. Feel free to explore our codebase, contribute, and embark on a motion sickness-free adventure with us! 🌄🌊🏞️
